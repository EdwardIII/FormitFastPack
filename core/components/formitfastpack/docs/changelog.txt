Changelog for FormitFastPack.

FormitFastPack 0.2 beta
======================================
- Revamped the caching. Most field types can now be called cached - [[!field]] - EXCEPT field types that need to be marked checked or selected (such as selects, radios, and checkboxes), which still need to be called uncached.
- Speed gains to uncached field snippets.
- Added usage tips.
- added [[+current_value_class]] placeholder
- added &delimiter_template parameter
- added optional &outer_type parameter to allow splitting up the outer_tpl (e.g. to position the label differently)
- renamed some "*_class" to "class_*" in the outer template to distinguish from dynamically-generated placeholders

FormitFastPack 0.1.1 beta - 0.1.4 beta
======================================
- added support for options and field_html generated from any element
- added error prefix override (for better compatibility with EditProfile)
- changed the default chunk names


FormitFastPack 0.1.0 beta
======================================
- starting version
